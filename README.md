WebView in Android Studio

what we learned:

WebView in Android Studio: WebView is a component in Android Studio that allows you to display web content, such as web pages or HTML-based content, within your Android app.

Enabling JavaScript: By default, JavaScript is disabled in WebView for security reasons. However, if your web content relies on JavaScript for interactivity, you should enable it using webView.getSettings().setJavaScriptEnabled(true);.

JavaScript Interface: You can create a bridge between JavaScript running in the WebView and Java code in your Android app using addJavascriptInterface() method. This allows communication and data exchange between WebView and Android app.

Loading HTML Content: You can load HTML content into the WebView from a local file (located in the assets folder) or from the internet using loadUrl().

WebViewClient: You can set a custom WebViewClient to control the behavior of link handling. This ensures that links open within the WebView itself rather than in external web browsers.

Interactive WebView: By combining JavaScript and WebView, you can create interactive experiences within your Android app, such as displaying web forms, handling user inputs, and showing dynamic content.

Overall, WebView provides a powerful way to integrate web-based functionalities into your Android app and create seamless interactions between web content and native Android code. However, it's essential to handle JavaScript execution and web content with security considerations in mind.
